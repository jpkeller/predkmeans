Title: Covariate Adaptive Clustering
Version: 0.0.4
Author: Joshua Keller
Maintainer: Joshua Keller <jkelle46@jhu.edu>
Description: Implements the predictive k-means method for clustering observations, using a mixture of experts model to allow covariates to influence cluster centers. Motivated by air pollution epidemiology settings, where cluster membership needs to be predicted across space. Includes functions for predicting cluster membership using spatial splines and PCA scores using either multinomial logistic regression or SVMs. For method details see Keller et al. (2017) <doi:10.1214/16-AOAS992>.
